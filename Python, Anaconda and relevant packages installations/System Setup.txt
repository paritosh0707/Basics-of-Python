# before we dive into ML lets setup our systems so that we can work with all our assignments, without facing problems

# as a first step lets install anaconda, you can choose the link that are mentioned below
choose the link which suits for your config
# as i am using windows 64bit system i will be downloading it with this link

# you can see its downloading.
# you can see its downloaded
#lets install it by clicking it
# make sure in that installation path there should not be any spaces 
# its better you install it like this 
# make sure that you click on that "add path" if you missed this part you might see some glitches while installing packages

#installation is complete
# lets just verify it
# its your call to install vs code if you want you can skip it
# its working fine
